Introduction
========================================================

The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:

1.  A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.

2.  A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.

Getting & Cleaning the Data - Initial Steps
========================================================

Before building the word prediction algorith, data is first processed and cleaned as the steps below:

- A subset of the original data was sampled from the three sources (blogs,twitter and news) which is then merged into one.
- Next, data cleaning is done by conversion to lowercase, strip white space, and removing punctuation and numbers.
- The corresponding n-grams are then created (Quadgram,Trigram and Bigram).
- Next, the term-count tables are extracted from the N-Grams and sorted according to the frequency in descending order.
- Lastly, the n-gram objects are saved as R-Compressed files (.RData files). 


Word Prediction Model
========================================================

The prediction model for next word is based on the Katz Back-off algorithm. Explanation of the next word prediction flow is as below:

- Compressed data sets containing descending frequency sorted n-grams are first loaded.
- User input words are cleaned in the similar way as before prior to prediction of the next word.
- For prediction of the next word, Quadgram is first used (first three words of Quadgram are the last three words of the user provided sentence).
- If no Quadgram is found, back off to Trigram (first two words of Trigram are the last two words of the sentence).
- If no Trigram is found, back off to Bigram (first word of Bigram is the last word of the sentence)
- If no Bigram is found, back off to the most common word with highest frequency 'the' is returned.


Shiny Application
========================================================

Based on the prediction model, a shiny app was created which allows users to type in a few words to begin the prediction of the next word. Please see the link below to demo the shiny app:
